      "care_instructions": "Venus flytraps are interesting carnivorous plants you can keep indoors to trap annoying flies that make their way into your home. These plants get their minerals, like nitrogen, from the insects they catch so need little to no soil or fertiliser. These plants are super thirsty though! It's easy to manage this by watering the plant from the bottom through a saucer.",

However, if you're able to put in the time and effort, you will be rewarded with an incredible flower.",
